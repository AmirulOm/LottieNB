## LottieNB - Lottie for Jupyter Notebooks

This is a simple python package to embed the default 
Lottie player in a Jupyter notebook.

### Why does this exist?

At LottieFiles we often find ourselves experimenting with tools
to generate animations from code. Often times we needed a quick
way to preview them.

### Usage

For usage, please check out the `sample.ipynb` notebook 
within this repo

### Installation

  * Install from git  
    `pip install git+https://github.com/LottieFiles/LottieNB.git`
